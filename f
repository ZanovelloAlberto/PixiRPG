/**
 * Container is a general-purpose display object that holds children. It also adds built-in support for advanced

 * and Sprite.
 *
 * ```js
 * import { BlurFilter } from '@pixi/filter-blur';
 * import { Container } from '@pixi/display';
 * import { Graphics } from '@pixi/graphics';
 * import { Sprite } from '@pixi/sprite';
 *
 * let container = new Container();

 *
 * sprite.width = 512;
 * sprite.height = 512;
 *
 * // Adds a sprite as a child to this container. As a result, the sprite will be rendered whenever the container
 * // is rendered.
 * container.addChild(sprite);
 *
 * // Blurs whatever is rendered by the container
 * container.filters = [new BlurFilter()];
 *
 * // Only the contents within a circle at the center should be rendered onto the screen.
 * container.mask = new Graphics()

 *
 * ## Transforms
 *
 * The [transform]{@link DisplayObject#transform} of a display object describes the projection from its
 * local coordinate space to its parent's local coordinate space. The following properties are derived
 * from the transform:
 *
 * <table>
 *   <thead>
 *     <tr>
 *       <th>Property</th>
 *       <th>Description</th>
 *     </tr>
 *   </thead>
 *   <tbody>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>[pivot]{@link PIXI.DisplayObject#pivot}</td>
 *       <td>
 *         Invariant under rotation, scaling, and skewing. The projection of into the parent's space of the pivot
 *         is equal to position, regardless of the other three transformations. In other words, It is the center of
 *         rotation, scaling, and skewing.
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>[position]{@link PIXI.DisplayObject#position}</td>
 *       <td>
 *         Translation. This is the position of the [pivot]{@link PIXI.DisplayObject#pivot} in the parent's local
 *         space. The default value of the pivot is the origin (0,0). If the top-left corner of your display object
 *         is (0,0) in its local space, then the position will be its top-left corner in the parent's local space.
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>[scale]{@link PIXI.DisplayObject#scale}</td>
 *       <td>
 *         Scaling. This will stretch (or compress) the display object's projection. The scale factors are along the
 *         local coordinate axes. In other words, the display object is scaled before rotated or skewed. The center
 *         of scaling is the [pivot]{@link PIXI.DisplayObject#pivot}.
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>[rotation]{@link PIXI.DisplayObject#rotation}</td>
 *       <td>
 *          Rotation. This will rotate the display object's projection by this angle (in radians).
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>[skew]{@link PIXI.DisplayObject#skew}</td>
 *       <td>
 *         <p>Skewing. This can be used to deform a rectangular display object into a parallelogram.</p>
 *         <p>
 *         In PixiJS, skew has a slightly different behaviour than the conventional meaning. It can be
 *         thought of the net rotation applied to the coordinate axes (separately). For example, if "skew.x" is
 *         ⍺ and "skew.y" is β, then the line x = 0 will be rotated by ⍺ (y = -x*cot⍺) and the line y = 0 will be
 *         rotated by β (y = x*tanβ). A line y = x*tanϴ (i.e. a line at angle ϴ to the x-axis in local-space) will
 *         be rotated by an angle between ⍺ and β.
 *         </p>
 *         <p>
 *         It can be observed that if skew is applied equally to both axes, then it will be equivalent to applying
 *         a rotation. Indeed, if "skew.x" = -ϴ and "skew.y" = ϴ, it will produce an equivalent of "rotation" = ϴ.
 *         </p>
 *         <p>
 *         Another quite interesting observation is that "skew.x", "skew.y", rotation are communtative operations. Indeed,
 *         because rotation is essentially a careful combination of the two.
 *         </p>
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>angle</td>
 *       <td>Rotation. This is an alias for [rotation]{@link PIXI.DisplayObject#rotation}, but in degrees.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>x</td>
 *       <td>Translation. This is an alias for position.x!</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>y</td>
 *       <td>Translation. This is an alias for position.y!</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>width</td>
 *       <td>
 *         Implemented in [Container]{@link PIXI.Container}. Scaling. The width property calculates scale.x by dividing
 *         the "requested" width by the local bounding box width. It is indirectly an abstraction over scale.x, and there
 *         is no concept of user-defined width.
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>height</td>
 *       <td>
 *         Implemented in [Container]{@link PIXI.Container}. Scaling. The height property calculates scale.y by dividing
 *         the "requested" height by the local bounding box height. It is indirectly an abstraction over scale.y, and there
 *         is no concept of user-defined height.
 *       </td>
 *     </tr>
 *   </tbody>
 * </table>
 *
 * ## Bounds
 *
 * The bounds of a display object is defined by the minimum axis-aligned rectangle in world space that can fit
 * around it. The abstract `calculateBounds` method is responsible for providing it (and it should use the
 * `worldTransform` to calculate in world space).
 *
 * There are a few additional types of bounding boxes:
 *
 * | Bounds                | Description                                                                              |
 * | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | World Bounds          | This is synonymous is the regular bounds described above. See `getBounds()`.             |
 * | Local Bounds          | This the axis-aligned bounding box in the parent's local space. See `getLocalBounds()`.  |
 * | Render Bounds         | The bounds, but including extra rendering effects like filter padding.                   |
 * | Projected Bounds      | The bounds of the projected display object onto the screen. Usually equals world bounds. |
 * | Relative Bounds       | The bounds of a display object when projected onto a ancestor's (or parent's) space.     |
 * | Natural Bounds        | The bounds of an object in its own local space (not parent's space, like in local bounds)|
 * | Content Bounds        | The natural bounds when excluding all children of a `Container`.                         |
 *
 * ### calculateBounds
 *
 * [Container]{@link Container} already implements `calculateBounds` in a manner that includes children.
 *
 * But for a non-Container display object, the `calculateBounds` method must be overridden in order for `getBounds` and
 * `getLocalBounds` to work. This method must write the bounds into `this._bounds`.
 *
 * Generally, the following technique works for most simple cases: take the list of points
 * forming the "hull" of the object (i.e. outline of the object's shape), and then add them
 * using {@link PIXI.Bounds#addPointMatrix}.
 *
 * ```js
 * calculateBounds(): void
 * {
 *     const points = [...];
 *
 *     for (let i = 0, j = points.length; i < j; i++)
 *     {
 *         this._bounds.addPointMatrix(this.worldTransform, points[i]);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can optimize this for a large number of points by using {@link PIXI.Bounds#addVerticesMatrix} to pass them
 * in one array together.
 *
 * ## Alpha
 *
 * This alpha sets a display object's **relative opacity** w.r.t its parent. For example, if the alpha of a display
 * object is 0.5 and its parent's alpha is 0.5, then it will be rendered with 25% opacity (assuming alpha is not
 * applied on any ancestor further up the chain).
 *
 * The alpha with which the display object will be rendered is called the [worldAlpha]{@link PIXI.DisplayObject#worldAlpha}.
 *
 * ## Renderable vs Visible
 *
 * The `renderable` and `visible` properties can be used to prevent a display object from being rendered to the
 * screen. However, there is a subtle difference between the two. When using `renderable`, the transforms  of the display
 * object (and its children subtree) will continue to be calculated. When using `visible`, the transforms will not
 * be calculated.
 *
 * It is recommended that applications use the `renderable` property for culling. See
 * [@pixi-essentials/cull]{@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pixi-essentials/cull} or
 * [pixi-cull]{@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixi-cull} for more details.
 *
 * Otherwise, to prevent an object from rendering in the general-purpose sense - `visible` is the property to use. This
 * one is also better in terms of performance.
